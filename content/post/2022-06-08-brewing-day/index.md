 Brew day is here! And now we await the results for the 'Bootstrap Brew' in 14 days. 
 
 This is my 7th brew so far over the course of 3 years or so. Since I bought the wort chiller it has drastically reduced the waiting time for the wort to cool from 3 hours to about 40 mins total.
 ### Wort Chiller

I had followed the all grain recipe for a classic summmer hazy IPA to a tee (including measuring the exact milliliters and grams for ingredients ). However it was later that night I had realized that my Original Gravity was below the expected amount.

It was only too late that I had realized my mistake. I was supposed to heat the mash water 10 degrees hotter than what the recipe calls for in order to account for the temperature drop with the introduction of the grains to the mash. This mistake will not ruin the beer but it could result in less starches being extracted during the process and inturn less sugar and less ABV%.
